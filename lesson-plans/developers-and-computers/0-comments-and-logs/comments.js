/* comments

  comments are for developers to read in the source code
  the computer will ignore them when parsing your program

  you can write multi-line comments like this one
    these are helpful at the top of a program to explain the main idea

  you can also write use single-line comments
    these are helpful for describing what's happening all over the program

  comments are a static help for the developer:
    they exist in the source code but do not influence the program's behavior
