## Learning Objectives

- 🥚 **Code Audiences**: You can explain how a single file of code is understood
  by:
  - **Developers**: A developer reads the code, comments and variable names to
    understand what the code is _intended_ to do.
  - **Computers**: A computer follows the code's instructions one step at a time
    to carry out a computation.
- 🐣 **Static vs. Dynamic**: There are two important ways you can understand the
  same source code:
  - **Static Analysis**: Studying the text in a code file _without_ running it.
    Static study includes reading the code, creating a flowchart, analyzing
    variables, and annotating the code.
  - **Dynamic Analysis**: _Running_ code and studying the computer's behavior as
    it executes your instructions. Dynamic study includes running code and
    reading console logs, filling out a trace table, and stepping through in a
    debugger.
- 🐣 **For Developers**
  - **Static**: Comments, variable names and code formatting help developers
    read and understand source code.
  - **Dynamic**: Logs and error messages help developers understand what is
    happening inside program memory as it follows the code's instructions.
    Debuggers also help see what is happening in memory, you'll study these
    later.
- 🐣 **For Computers**
  - **Static**: _Source Code_ is a text file with code a computer can
    understand. These _static_ instructions define how the _dynamic_ program
    will behave.
  - **Dynamic**: A running program uses variables to read and write _Program
    Memory_ one step at a time, following your instructions to carry out a
    computation.

## Developers

Developers are the ones designing the software, writing the code, and fixing the
bugs. As a developer you'll spend lots of time reading source code. So it's very
important to make sure your code is easy to understand.

You should think first of other developers who will need to understand your
program, and second of yourself. Why is this more productive? First because
working on a team is easier when everyone is looking out for each other. Second
because one day you'll be someone else! After even half an hour your thoughts
about a program are no longer fresh, you'll need to rely on what you wrote to
figure out the details of your own program.

## Computers

You've been the user of many websites, you've even developed a few with HTML &
CSS, but you haven't had to _be the computer_ yet. With HTML & CSS it's enough
to learn what goes in and what comes out, you don't need to know what happens in
between:

- HTML/CSS goes into a browser -> ... ? ... -> a website is displayed

With JavaScript it's the complete opposite. What the program _does_ (inputs ->
outputs) is less important than _how it happens_. Your goal now isn't to amaze
the user, it's to become the computer and understand what happens between the
input and the output:

- source code -> **a lot of important steps** -> final output
